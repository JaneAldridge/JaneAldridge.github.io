<p class=MsoNormal><b>Initial Post</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>by Jane Aldridge - Wednesday, 19 October 2022, 12:35 PM</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Number of replies: 2</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Time to Change the CVSS - What characteristics of CVSS do
the authors (Spring et al, 2021) criticise?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>1)      The Lack of Justification for the CVSS Formula</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The authors state that a major issue with the calculation of
CVSS scores, is that to calculate a base score, eight questions have to be
answered, and these questions are based on qualitative data. These answers are
then converted into a scale between 0 and 10.  The CVSS v3.0 equation was based
on data from experts who ranked 100 vulnerabilities.  So the basis of the data
is qualitative.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The authors also make the point that the CVSS documentation
is not transparent about how the vulnerability score is calculated, and that
qualitative measurements should not be converted into numbers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I agree that CVSS relies solely on the judgement of human
assessors, and so this is subjective, even if an assessor is off by several
points on a 10 point scale, it will alter the scoring significantly (Campagna,
2020).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>2)      Operational Problems with Scoring </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The authors also highlight the problems with assigning
scoring, in terms of inconsistencies and vague guidelines. To demonstrate this
the authors carried out a survey and found that 50% of experienced security
professionals surveyed mis-scored vulnerabilities using CVSS (Spring et al,
2021). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In addition, the authors state that CVSS defaults to the
assumption of ´assume the worst´, in terms of the impact of a vulnerability. 
CVSS does not use public repositories of exploits, such as Metaspoilt or exploitDB,
which would provide data to refine the impact of a vulnerability.    </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In fact, CVSS needs to correlate data from a number of
sources (Aboud, 2020), which would include threat and exploit intelligence
data.  In addition, CVSS needs to include an assessment of current and
predicted future attacker activity, as well as taking into consideration the
age of a vulnerability, its potential for harm, the degree to which it is
exploitable and how frequently the threat is being seen (Aboud, 2020)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>3)      CVSS scores severity, not security risk</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The authors state that CVSS categorises vulnerabilities in
terms of severity, that severity is then used to prioritise vulnerabilities in
terms of remediation (Spring et al, 2021), but that using CVSS as a risk score
is not correct, although many organisations do use CVSS directly as a risk
score. As examples they refer to the US government and the payment card
industry. The article not only states that CVSS does not support risk scoring,
but it goes further and states that ´it fails to inform vulnerability
management´. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I think an important point here is the difference between
vulnerability scoring and risk.  Vulnerability refers to a weakness in
hardware, software and procedures, whereas risk is the potential for lost,
damaged or destroyed assets (Glover, 2022). So risk must take into account the
probability of an event happening, whereas vulnerability scoring will not. 
Risk also needs to look at the broader context, so as an example, rather than
looking at a risk in isolation there could be a chain of vulnerabilities which
could increase the risk impact and also the probability of an event occurring. 
Spring et al, also make this point that context and the chain of potential
events needs to be taken into account, which CVSS does not do :</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>´CVSS does not account, broadly for context….. related or
chained vulnerabilities…. and different interpretations of a CVSS score in
different communities´</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The authors state that organisations want to know the risk
of a vulnerability and the priority of a vulnerability, in terms of how quickly
they should respond and remediate a vulnerability. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I agree that CVSS should not be used as a risk score. 
Gunter Ollman (September 2019) states that CVSS should never be used as a risk
score, and that it is an important variable in the risk calculation but is not
adequate to calculate risk in itself.  Abby Ross (2019) also backs up this
view, that CVSS is being misused as a risk score.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4)      Failure to Account for Context</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4.1) Technical Context</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The authors state that there are various ways that CVSS does
not take into account context, firstly in terms of the technical context :</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>CVSS does not capture the complexity of shared libraries,
for example, where specific functions are being called</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> Vulnerabilities can be chained together, increasing risk,
although CVSS v3.0 provides some guidance about vulnerability chaining it isn’t
sufficient</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Web vulnerabilities are not taken into account</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>CVSS uses technical severities of low, medium, high,
critical but there are no definitions for these scores, and also the
definitions could change depending on the organisational context</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Gunter Ollman (September 2019) states that CVSS was intended
to score vulnerabilities in the context of software and devices, but not from a
system context, which supports the view that CVSS does not support chained
vulnerabilities or even system level vulnerabilities.  CVSS does not consider
the relationship between vulnerabilities, as an example CVSS would not link the
ability of an attacker to escalate privileges and then attack insecure
misconfigurations (Ross, 2019)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4.2) Organisational Context</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A really important point that the authors make is that CVSS
gives equal waiting to vulnerabilities in terms of confidentiality, integrity
and availability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, the weighting will depend on the context, as an
example data loss, in terms of confidentiality is going to be more important to
a regulated financial institution and availability is going to be more
important for embedded devices medical devices, like pace makers.  The authors
do make the point that CVSS v3.1 provides an option for adjusting the
importance of confidentiality, integrity and availability, but state that
because the adjustment is part of the CVSS formula it is not transparent and so
it cannot be determined if this is an adequate solution.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The CVSS score for a bank should be different for an Oil company
like BP or Shell, even if the vulnerabilities were the same.  Gunter Ollman
states that every industry assesses risk differently and each business has its
own risk factor qualification which an external party won´t know. CVSS does not
take into account the bigger risk picture and is just one component of the risk
picture (Ross, 2019). CVSS also does not take into consideration the value of
an exposed asset to an organisation (Ross, 2019). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>5)      Failure to Account for Consequences</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The authors state that the score should include the
consequences of an exploitation.  CVSS 3.0 tries to address the likelihood of a
vulnerability being exploited, but assumes widespread exploitation. The authors
further make the point that high CVSS scores are not correlated to whether a
vulnerability will be exploited. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I agree that CVSS needs to take into account the potential
for exploitation and also the criticality of an asset (Ross, 2019).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>6)      Not all Vulnerabilities are Captured</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The authors also make the point that CVSS is not going to
capture threats such as misconfigurations, incorrect default settings, and the
threats that arise from the integration of systems. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>7)      An Alternative – SSVC</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>SSVC (Stakeholder- Specific Vulnerability Categorization) is
an alternative to CVSS proposed by Spring et al.  In my view this methodology
is a better alternative, due to the following reasons, which try to address the
issues with CVSS listed previously: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7.1) One of the key advantages of SSVC is that it tries to
avoid a ‘one-size-fits-all solution’ (Spring et al, 2019). I think this is an
important point, organisations are complex as are the systems which support
them, and all organisations are different and none of them will have the same
vulnerabilities. I think that CVSS takes an overly simplistic approach to
capturing vulnerabilities. SSVC focuses on the decision making aspect of
vulnerability management, which is the ultimate outcome of CVSS, to make
decisions about priorities and where to focus resources.  SSVC uses a framework
which identifies the inputs, determines the aspects of vulnerability management
which are in scope, and also defines the context (Spring et al, 2019).  SSVC
tries to capture the fact that all organisations are different, and also it
aims to deal with organisational complexity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 7.2) SSVC uses decision trees to support the decision
making process. The decision tree shows the important elements of a decision,
possible decision values and possible outcomes.  The decision trees are used to
provide advice about vulnerability prioritization and are easily understood by
stakeholders. CVSS uses technical severity as the key factor, not the decision
which is the ultimate outcome. Some of the decision points will require
substantial analysis but this is to be expected, because analysing vulnerabilities
in any organisation is going to take time and multiple iterations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 7.3)   SSVC states that it is as qualitative approach, it
doesn’t provide a ‘false sense of security’ by using numerical
representations.  Unless there is a source(s) of data which is actually proven
for all vulnerabilities and different organisations, then a numerical
representation is too simplistic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>‘Each vulnerability has a potentially unique relationship to
the socio-technical system in which it exists, including the internet.  The
context of the vulnerability, and the systems it impacts, are inextricably
linked to managing it. Temporal and environmental considerations should be
primary’ (Spring et al, 2019)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Organisations are too complex and each has a different
environment to use a purely quantitative approach. Industry 4.0 increases
complexity and causes a greater shift of risk to external vulnerabilities,
which are external to an organisation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7.4) SSVC involves key stakeholders in the decision
modelling process, and this makes sense, because these stakeholders will have a
greater awareness of the potential vulnerabilities than just using a checklist
of questions, proposed by CVSS, which was created on the basis of experts who
did not have the organisational context.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 7.5)  SSVC does not use numerical scores, I think this is
an advantage because it eliminates a false sense of security, from the decision
making process. Vulnerability management is complex, and stakeholders need to
understand the risks, and not rely on a numerical scoring system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 7.6) SSVC and Current Information Sources</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The authors propose that decision points can also be
informed by using vendor feeds of vulnerabilities, if a valid feed can be
matched to an organisation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b> Summary</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are obvious drawbacks to CCVS as mentioned in this
post, and my view is that it simplifies vulnerability management, and cannot be
effective because it doesn’t take into account the broader context, and
environmental factors, as well as the fact that each organisation is unique and
there needs to be a method which is flexible enough to deal with each unique
organisation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is not possible to have a ‘one size fits all’ method,
CVSS is too rigid and is also misleading by providing a numerical
representation, which is not based on ‘real data’.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>SSVC attempts to capture the complexity of different
organisations and focuses on the outcome of vulnerability management which is
to support the decision making process in terms of which vulnerabilities to fix
and where to focus resources. It does this by involving stakeholders, who are
familiar with the organisation and using decision trees.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With industry 4.0 I think that CVSS will become even more
ineffective in being able to manage vulnerabilities, because it doesn’t model
the organisational context sufficiently. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Re: Initial Post</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>by Iason Rigas - Wednesday, 19 October 2022, 2:01 PM</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hi Jane,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That was indeed a very complete and in-depth overview of the
topic. One question which comes to my mind reading our forums and the
discussions on CVSS is how easy will it be for a complete industry to move away
from CVSS to CCVS having witnessed already the sometimes how companies and
vendors find it difficult to move between versions of CVSS itself. As Industry
4.0 is coming along together with IoT devices and other new technologies it
becomes difficult to understand the possible impact on safety by looking at the
individual metrics.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We are accustomed to look into scoring from a
confidentiality, integrity and availability vector perspective. As Klidenist
points out safety and the potential for loss of life is a real concern in
Industry 4.0 technologies including the modern automotive industry. So as you
mentioned not only CVSS is not able to model the organisational context
sufficiently but it also fails to include metrics which are relevant for the
technological context and the environment in which the technology operates. I
would also argue whether it would be reasonable to expect CVSS to be able to
cope as a metric with risks which extend beyond the topics of information
technology, such as the potential for loss of life. Similar questions have been
raised in the past with respect to SCADA systems and potential safety
implication but without coming up with a scoring system for addressing such
threats.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hi Iason,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thank you for your feedback on my post.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In terms of how easy it will be for the industry to move
away from CVSS, it will be a ‘paradigm shift’, but I do believe that this is
possible, because of the inherent flaws in CCVS (Spring et al, 2021). When I
started to work on this analysis, I was not planning to propose that SSVC
replaces CVSS, instead I was thinking that CVSS could incorporate aspects of
SSVC, because it doesn’t make sense to ‘reinvent the wheel’, especially as CVSS
is widely used throughout the industry. However after reading the paper
‘Prioritizing vulnerability response: A stakeholder-specific vulnerability
categorization’ by Spring et al (2021), I realised that CVSS is fundamentally
flawed. There have been similar paradigm shifts, such as the move from the
waterfall development methodology to agile, which was actually a greater change
for the technology industry, than moving from CVSS to a different framework
like SSVC (Lynn, 2022).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I think that the driver which could make this shift happen,
is if vulnerabilities which were not identified or prioritised by CVSS manifest
themselves in significant incidents or exploits. More and more failings of CVSS
will become apparent due to industry 4.0, because CVSS is very inward looking,
it doesn’t look at the broader organisational context. I included some blogs in
my analysis because they were from practitioners of CVSS, who were obviously
frustrated by its’ failings. As an example, here is a quote from Ross, A (2019)
:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>‘our X-Force Red hackers have seen time and time again
vulnerabilities with CVSS scores of 10 bumped to the top of the priority list
even though the assets they could affect would only cause minimal impact to the
business if they were compromised. High scores were also attributed to
vulnerabilities even when criminals were not exploiting them in the wild at
that time.’</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The fact that CVSS is used by the US government and
leveraged by payments processing, also means that if there is a major incident,
which CVSS has not captured, due to a missed vulnerability, then there will be
lot of focus on how to improve or replace CVSS.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An article explaining why a major consultancy is moving away
from CVSS also backs up this view (Schwartz, 2021).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In terms of your comment that CVSS is not able to cope with
risks, which extend beyond information technology, I would go further than this
and state that CVSS is not a risk methodology, it just deals with
vulnerabilities, which are different (Spring et al, 2021).</p>
